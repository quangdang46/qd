# Story Map: Phase <N> - <Phase Name>

**Date**: <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Phase Plan**: `._qd/history/<feature>/phase-plan.md`
**Phase Contract**: `._qd/history/<feature>/phase-<n>-contract.md`
**Approach Reference**: `._qd/history/<feature>/approach.md`

## 1. Story Dependency Diagram

    E[Entry State] --> S1[Story 1]
    S1 --> S2[Story 2]
    S2 --> S3[Story 3]
    S3 --> X[Exit State]
```

Replace the placeholder story nodes with the actual story names. If multiple stories can run in parallel, show that explicitly:

## 2. Story Table

| Story | What Happens In This Story | Why Now | Contributes To | Creates | Unlocks | Done Looks Like |
|-------|-----------------------------|---------|----------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Story 1: `<name>` | `<practical outcome>` | `<why first>` | `<phase exit-state item>` | `<artifact or capability>` | `<next story>` | `<observable proof>` |
| Story 2: `<name>` | `<practical outcome>` | `<why next>` | `<phase exit-state item>` | `<artifact or capability>` | `<next story>` | `<observable proof>` |
| Story 3: `<name>` | `<practical outcome>` | `<why last>` | `<phase exit-state item>` | `<artifact or capability>` | `<what comes after phase>` | `<observable proof>` |

## 3. Story Details

### Story 1: <Name>

- **What Happens In This Story**: `<what becomes true after this story>`
- **Why Now**: `<why it belongs before the next story>`
- **Contributes To**: `<which exit-state statement this story advances>`
- **Creates**: `<code, contract, data, capability>`
- **Unlocks**: `<what later stories can now do>`
- **Done Looks Like**: `<observable finish line>`
- **Candidate Bead Themes**:
  - `<bead theme 1>`
  - `<bead theme 2>`

### Story 2: <Name>

- **What Happens In This Story**: `<what becomes true after this story>`
- **Why Now**: `<why it belongs here>`
- **Contributes To**: `<which exit-state statement this story advances>`
- **Creates**: `<code, contract, data, capability>`
- **Unlocks**: `<what later stories can now do>`
- **Done Looks Like**: `<observable finish line>`
- **Candidate Bead Themes**:
  - `<bead theme 1>`
  - `<bead theme 2>`

### Story 3: <Name>

- **What Happens In This Story**: `<what becomes true after this story>`
- **Why Now**: `<why it closes the phase>`
- **Contributes To**: `<which exit-state statement this story advances>`
- **Creates**: `<code, contract, data, capability>`
- **Unlocks**: `<next phase or larger plan>`
- **Done Looks Like**: `<observable finish line>`
- **Candidate Bead Themes**:
  - `<bead theme 1>`
  - `<bead theme 2>`

Remove any unused story sections and keep only the stories the phase actually needs.

## 4. Story Order Check

> If a human reads only this file, the first question they should not need to ask is "why is Story 1 first?"

- [ ] Story 1 is obviously first
- [ ] Every later story builds on or de-risks an earlier story
- [ ] If every story reaches "Done Looks Like", the phase exit state should be true

If any box is unchecked, revise the map before creating beads.

## 5. Story-To-Bead Mapping

> Fill this in after bead creation so validating and swarming can see how the narrative maps to executable work.

| Story | Beads | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Story 1: `<name>` | `<br-id>, <br-id>` | `<shared context or dependency note>` |
| Story 2: `<name>` | `<br-id>, <br-id>` | `<shared context or dependency note>` |
| Story 3: `<name>` | `<br-id>, <br-id>` | `<shared context or dependency note>` |
