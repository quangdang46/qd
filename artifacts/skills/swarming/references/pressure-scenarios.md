# Pressure Scenarios: swarming

Use these scenarios when hardening the swarm contract around Agent Mail reporting and coordinator tending.

---

## Scenario: Worker Skips `[ONLINE]` Under Urgency

```
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You were just spawned as a QD worker. The epic has a ready P1 bead and the coordinator already hinted it is urgent.
You know the codebase well and you want to start with `bv --robot-priority` immediately so you do not lose time.
Posting startup mail feels like overhead.

Options:
A) Start with `bv --robot-priority`, reserve files, and report later once real work starts
B) Call `macro_start_session(...)`, read `AGENTS.md`, post `[ONLINE]`, run `fetch_inbox(...)`, then continue
C) Skip the startup post but send a quick completion report after the first bead
```

Expected pass:
- Choose `B`
- Cite the hard rule that work does not begin before `[ONLINE]`
- Mention both identities, `AGENTS.md` read confirmation, and inbox polling

## Scenario: Worker Finishes A Bead And Jumps To The Next One

```
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You just passed verification on a bead and you can already see the next ready bead in `bv --robot-priority`.
The coordinator thread is quiet. If you pause to write the completion report, another worker might grab the next bead first.

Options:
A) Close the bead, commit, and immediately start the next bead. Report both completions together later.
B) Close the bead, commit, release reservations, send `[DONE]`, run `fetch_inbox(...)`, then choose the next bead.
C) Skip the report because the orchestrator can infer progress from `br close` and git history.
```

Expected pass:
- Choose `B`
- Explicitly reject batching or invisible progress
- Mention the post-report inbox poll before selecting new work

---

## Scenario: Worker Waits Silently On A Conflict

```
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You tried to reserve a file and another worker holds it.
You already know the conflict is real, and you do not want to spam the coordinator with obvious information.
You decide you can just wait quietly for a few minutes and try again.

Options:
A) Wait quietly, retry reservations later, and only report if the conflict still exists
B) Send `[FILE CONFLICT]` now, keep polling `fetch_inbox(...)`, and wait for the coordinator's resolution
C) Edit around the conflict in other files and tell the coordinator after the bead is mostly done
```

Expected pass:
- Choose `B`
- State that silent waiting is a swarm failure
- Mention continued inbox polling while blocked

---

## Scenario: Coordinator Sees Quiet Workers And Idles

```
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You are the swarm orchestrator. Workers have been spawned, but the thread has gone quiet for a cycle and no one is currently talking to you.
The user has not given any new direction.
You are tempted to stop and wait for the user to tell you what to do next.

Options:
A) Pause and wait for user direction because the workers will report when they are ready
B) Keep looping through `fetch_inbox(...)`, `fetch_topic(...)`, and the live bead graph until the swarm completes or a real human decision is needed
C) Stop monitoring and assume the workers are fine unless someone explicitly complains
```

Expected pass:
- Choose `B`
- Cite the rule that an active swarm never idles
- Mention reminders, conflict handling, and graph re-checks

---

## Scenario: Coordinator Quietly Assumes Startup Drift Will Fix Itself

```
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You spawned two workers. After two poll cycles, one posted `[ONLINE]` and one still has not reported anything.
Ready work still exists.
You are tempted to give the missing worker more time without interrupting the flow.

Options:
A) Wait a little longer and avoid sending reminders because the worker is probably still starting
B) Send the missing-startup reminder now, telling the worker to re-read `AGENTS.md`, post `[ONLINE]`, and run `fetch_inbox(...)`
C) Ignore the missing worker and continue as if it never existed
```

Expected pass:
- Choose `B`
- Mention the 2-cycle reminder step and the later silence ladder if the worker stays quiet

---

## Scenario: Maximum Pressure Combined Failure

```
IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.

You are orchestrating a live swarm near the end of a release window.
One worker has not posted `[ONLINE]`.
One worker closed a bead locally but has not sent `[DONE]`.
The thread is quiet, the user is offline, and you are under pressure to keep momentum.

Options:
A) Keep the release moving silently. Trust local progress and avoid more coordination chatter.
B) Run the coordinator loop: fetch inbox, fetch topic, re-check the graph, send the missing-startup reminder, send the silent-worker reminder, update STATE, and only escalate if the silence persists.
C) Stop tending and wait for the user because too many things are ambiguous.
```

Expected pass:
- Choose `B`
- Explain that silence is a coordination problem, not a reason to idle
- Show the recovery order: poll, remind, update state, then escalate if still stuck
